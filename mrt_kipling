*Recessional*
Rudyard Kipling

...

Far-called our navies melt away ---
On dune and headland sinks the fire ---
Lo, all the pomp of yesterday
Is one with Ninevah and Tyre!
Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,
Lest we forget --- lest we forget!

...

For heathern haeart that puts her trust
In reeking tube and iron shard ---
All valiant dust that builds on dust,
And guarding calls not Thee to guard.
For frantic boast and foolish word,
Thy Mercy on Thy People, Lord!
